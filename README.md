**Epsilon the Cat**

# Motivation
I got to look after a cat named Epsilon for close to 10 months while her owner went for study exchange. 

After returning her to the owner, I kinda miss her. 

I miss that whenever I said her name “Epsilon”, she knew it’s food time and ran from where-ever she’s sleeping to the kitchen.

I took the chance of creating a personal project, while following Codecademy's Computer Science curriculum, to create this little game dedicated to Epsilon

# How to play
Use WASD or arrow keys to move Epsilon to food
